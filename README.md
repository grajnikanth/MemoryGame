# Web Development Project 2 - Memory Game

This project was developed as part of the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree. I built a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game! The starter code for the game images was provided by udacity starter code.

This project contains a directory called /fend-project-memory-game/ which contains all the files related to the
memory game finished project.
The main files are the index.html, /js/app.js and /CSS/app.css.
These are the three file where all my work was done.
